# Regression output

## Regression 1
In the code below from `regression1.R` we illustrate once again how we obtain our regression output. In regression1, we define long-term listings as listings that are booked for more than 28 days. 

In total we have this many short-listings and longs-listings:
```{r}
length(listings_short)
length(listings_long)

```


This output is based on the dataframe `wide_df100` that contains information on all listings id's and the 100 most popular amenities.


```{r}
significant_amenities_100 <- c()
dep_vars <- names(wide_df100[3:102])

for (dep_var in dep_vars) {
  str <- paste(dep_var, "~ listing_type")  
  model <- lm(str, wide_df100)
  summary <- summary(model)
  
  if (summary$coefficients[2, 4] < 0.05) {
    
    if (summary$coefficients[2, 1] < 0) {
      significant_amenities_100 <- c(significant_amenities_100, dep_var)
    }
  }
}

```

The function and loop above returns amenities that are significantly more available in long-term listings compared to short-term listings. It stores this in the list called `significant_amenities_100`. If we print this list, we see the 20 amenities that are thus more available in long-term AirBnb's (>28 days).

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(significant_amenities_100)
```

## Regression 2
For our second regression, `regression2.R`, we obtained our regression output with the same loops as for `regression1.R`. However, in regression2 we define long-term listings as listings that are booked for more than 56 days. We do this because the group of long-listings identified as >28 days booked is way larger than the short-listings group. 

In total we have this many short-listings and longs-listings:
```{r}
length(listings_short2)
length(listings_long2)

```


The same function and loop as with regression1 returns amenities that are significantly more available in long-term listings compared to short-term listings, but stores this in the list called `significant_amenities_100_2`. If we print this list, we see the *20** amenities that are thus more available in long-term AirBnb's (>56 days).

```{r}
print(significant_amenities_100_2)
```


# Plots

We can visualize our results with the use of the `ggplot2` package. 
The plot below contains the 20 amenities that are more available in long-term listings. It shows the **proportion** of AirBnB's (both long-term and short-term listings) that contain these amenities. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Data input
ggplot(data = counts, aes(x = reorder(amenities, -prop_long), decreasing = TRUE)) +
  
# Barplot for short-term and long-term  
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop_long, fill = "Long-term"), position = "dodge2", stat = "identity") +
  geom_bar(aes(y = prop_short, fill = "Short-term"), position = "dodge2", stat = "identity") +
  
# Theme and text
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightcoral","brown4")) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of AirBnB listings containing amenities",
       x = "Amenities",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "") +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50, hjust = 1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2))
